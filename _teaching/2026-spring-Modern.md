This course develops a unified inference toolkit for real-world data where the data-collection mechanism is nontrivial: \textbf{survey sampling}, \textbf{missing data}, and \textbf{causal inference}. A recurring theme is that valid inference requires explicit reasoning about the \emph{mechanism}---sampling design, nonresponse/missingness, or treatment assignment---and that modern methods (IPW, doubly robust estimators, semiparametric efficiency, ML-assisted inference) can be understood within a common framework. To motivate these ideas, we take a \emph{historical perspective}, tracing how \emph{classical problems and early debates} in statistics led to today’s emphasis on \emph{valid inference, efficiency, and robustness}, and using these milestones to cultivate \emph{statistical thinking}.
