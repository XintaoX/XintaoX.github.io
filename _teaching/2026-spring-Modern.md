This course develops a unified inference toolkit for real-world data where the data-collection mechanism is nontrivial: **survey sampling**, **missing data**, and **causal inference**. A recurring theme is that valid inference requires explicit reasoning about the *mechanism*—sampling design, nonresponse/missingness, or treatment assignment—and that modern methods (IPW, doubly robust estimators, semiparametric efficiency, ML-assisted inference) can be understood within a common framework. To motivate these ideas, we take a *historical perspective*, tracing how *classical problems and early debates* in statistics led to today’s emphasis on *valid inference, efficiency, and robustness*, and using these milestones to cultivate *statistical thinking*.
